# Jobs

Easily author and add [Parameterized Jobs](https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/reusing-config/#authoring-parameterized-jobs) to the `src/jobs` directory.

Each _YAML_ file within this directory will be treated as an orb job, with a name which matches its filename.

Jobs may invoke orb commands and other steps to fully automate tasks with minimal user configuration.
